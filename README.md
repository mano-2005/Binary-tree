# Binary tree# Expression Tree from Postfix Expression

A C++ program to construct an expression tree from a given postfix expression and display its post-order traversal.

---

## Features

- Constructs a binary expression tree from a postfix expression.
- Supports operands (alphanumeric characters) and operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, etc.).
- Performs post-order traversal to print the postfix expression from the constructed tree.

---

## How It Works

1. **Input:** 
   - A postfix expression as a string (e.g., `"ab+ef*g*-"`).
2. **Process:** 
   - Constructs an expression tree using a stack-based approach.
   - Handles operands (leaf nodes) and operators (internal nodes).
3. **Output:** 
   - Displays the post-order traversal of the constructed tree.

## Code Structure

### Classes and Functions
- **`TreeNode` Class**:
  - Represents a node in the expression tree.
  - Stores data and pointers to left and right child nodes.

- **`constructTree` Function**:
  - Builds the expression tree from a postfix expression.
  - Uses a stack to manage tree nodes during construction.

- **`postOrderTraversal` Function**:
  - Traverses the expression tree in post-order and prints the nodes.

- **`isAlphanumeric` Function**:
  - Checks if a character is an operand.
